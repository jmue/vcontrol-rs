This is a Rust library for communication with Viessmann heating controllers.

The included `Optolink` struct is a low-level abstraction for an Optolink connection over either a TCP socket or a serial port.

The `VControl` struct is a high-level abstraction for a complete system, which can be configured with a YAML file, much like what [`vcontrold`](https://github.com/openv/vcontrold) does with an XML file.
